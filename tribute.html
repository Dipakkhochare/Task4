        <p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (10 December 1815 â€“ 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.</p>
        <p>Her notes on the engine include what is now considered to be the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. Because of this, she is often regarded as the world's first computer programmer.</p>
        <p>Ada Lovelace passed away at the age of 36 but her contributions to computer science continue to inspire generations.</p>
